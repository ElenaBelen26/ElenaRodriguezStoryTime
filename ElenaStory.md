## My Story
One day I was sitting on a bridge and this bug started buzzing around my head.
This bug was the most annoying thing I've ever encountered.
As I was shooing the bug away I lost my balance and fell right into the water!
I thought to myself that I needed to get out of the fridged water and find the 
nearest buillding so I could find my way home.
After I got out of the water I thought to myself, 
"I know! I'll use my compass and I'll be home in no time."
As I pull my compass out of my pocket and look at it the arrow is going bonkers!
I don't understand. How could the magnet be busted?
By this time it was so late I had to just depend on the stars to get me home.
When I was walking home I found the most elaborate clock tower I'd ever seen. 
After all, this drama filled day still could'nt get me down.
